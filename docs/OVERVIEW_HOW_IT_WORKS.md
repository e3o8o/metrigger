# Trig Network: Complete Ecosystem Overview

## Executive Summary

Trig Network is a decentralized parametric condition protocol that enables automated, trustless execution based on real-world events across multiple blockchain networks. The ecosystem consists of two main components: **Trig Network** (the protocol infrastructure) and **Trig Tickets** (the first consumer application).

## Core Components

### 1. Condition Registry
The heart of Trig Network that manages all parametric conditions across chains.

```solidity
contract ConditionRegistry {
    // Stores all active conditions
    mapping(bytes32 => Condition) public conditions;
    
    // Manages condition lifecycle
    function createCondition() external;
    function resolveCondition() external;
    function executeCondition() external;
}
```

### 2. Cross-Chain Router
Handles communication between different blockchain networks using LayerZero.

```solidity
contract CrossChainRouter {
    // Sends messages across chains
    function sendMessage() external payable;
    
    // Receives and processes incoming messages
    function lzReceive() external;
}
```

### 3. Oracle Manager
Aggregates and verifies real-world data from multiple sources.

```solidity
contract OracleManager {
    // Manages approved data providers
    address[] public approvedOracles;
    
    // Requests and verifies data
    function requestData() external returns (bytes32 requestId);
    function verifyData() external view returns (bool valid);
}
```

### 4. Extension System
Modular system for different types of parametric conditions.

```solidity
interface ITrigExtension {
    function createCondition() external returns (bytes32);
    function resolveCondition() external returns (bool);
    function executeCondition() external;
}
```

## How It Works: Step by Step

### Step 1: Condition Creation
1. **User Request**: User wants to create a parametric condition (e.g., flight delay protection)
2. **Extension Selection**: Appropriate extension is selected (e.g., FlightDelayExtension)
3. **Parameter Definition**: Condition parameters are set (flight number, delay threshold, payout amount)
4. **Cross-chain Deployment**: Condition is deployed across relevant chains via LayerZero

### Step 2: Data Verification
1. **Oracle Request**: Protocol requests data from multiple approved oracles
2. **Consensus Check**: Compares responses from different data sources
3. **Validation**: Ensures data meets quality and accuracy thresholds
4. **On-chain Storage**: Verified data is stored on-chain for transparency

### Step 3: Condition Evaluation
1. **Automatic Monitoring**: Protocol continuously monitors condition parameters
2. **Threshold Check**: Checks if real-world data meets condition criteria
3. **Consensus Validation**: Multiple nodes verify the condition outcome
4. **Result Determination**: Final decision on whether condition is triggered

### Step 4: Execution & Payout
1. **Smart Contract Execution**: Automatic execution of pre-defined actions
2. **Cross-chain Settlement**: Funds moved between chains if necessary
3. **Payout Distribution**: Automated transfer to designated recipients
4. **Event Logging**: Complete audit trail stored on-chain

## Trig Tickets: Consumer Application

Trig Tickets demonstrates the protocol's capabilities through a consumer-facing ticket protection application.

### How Trig Tickets Works

#### 1. Ticket Purchase with Protection
```typescript
// Example: Buying a concert ticket with built-in protection
const ticketPurchase = {
    event: "Coldplay Concert",
    date: "2024-12-15",
    price: "$150",
    protection: {
        type: "EVENT_CANCELLATION",
        payout: "100%", // Full refund if cancelled
        premium: "$15" // 10% of ticket price
    }
};
```

#### 2. Automatic Protection Activation
- Protection starts immediately after purchase
- Conditions are deployed on Trig Network protocol
- Real-time monitoring begins
- User receives confirmation with condition details

#### 3. Real-time Monitoring
- Continuously checks event status from multiple sources
- Monitors weather conditions for outdoor events
- Tracks artist health and travel status
- Watches for venue issues or closures

#### 4. Instant Claims Processing
```solidity
// Automatic payout when conditions are met
function processCancellation(bytes32 conditionId) external {
    if (conditionRegistry.isTriggered(conditionId)) {
        uint256 payoutAmount = conditions[conditionId].payoutAmount;
        address attendee = conditions[conditionId].beneficiary;
        
        // Automatic refund processing
        paymentProcessor.refund(attendee, payoutAmount);
        
        emit ProtectionPaid(conditionId, attendee, payoutAmount);
    }
}
```

## Technical Innovation

### 1. Omnichain Parametric Conditions
- Conditions can span multiple blockchain networks
- Execution happens on optimal chain for cost and speed
- Unified user experience across chains

### 2. Multi-Source Data Consensus
```solidity
// Ensures data reliability through consensus
function verifyFlightDelay(string memory flightNumber) internal {
    uint256[] memory delays = new uint256[](oracles.length);
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < oracles.length; i++) {
        delays[i] = IOracle(oracles[i]).getFlightDelay(flightNumber);
    }
    
    // Require consensus from multiple sources
    require(_hasConsensus(delays), "No oracle consensus");
}
```

### 3. Gas-Efficient Cross-Chain Messaging
- LayerZero integration for low-cost cross-chain communication
- Batch processing to minimize transaction costs
- Optimized for small parametric condition payloads

### 4. Modular Extension System
```solidity
// Easy to create new condition types
contract WeatherDelayExtension is ITrigExtension {
    function evaluateWeatherCondition() external {
        // Custom weather evaluation logic
    }
}

contract SportsOutcomeExtension is ITrigExtension {
    function evaluateGameResult() external {
        // Sports result evaluation logic
    }
}
```

## Economic Model
